You're testing DNSCrypt, a first-of-its-kind service that encrypts all DNS packets between your computer and OpenDNS.

Encrypting DNS traffic protects against two important threats:  First, it prevents man-in-the-middle attacks which can cause malicious DNS responses to be used to trick you into visiting a dangerous website or send traffic to an unintended third party. Second, it prevents snooping by your ISP or any other intermediary who might want to sniff your DNS traffic to see what domains you are resolving.

When using a public hotspot, an untrusted network, or generally any Internet connection you don't control, it's wise to use DNSCrypt to protect your DNS traffic from tampering and snooping.
