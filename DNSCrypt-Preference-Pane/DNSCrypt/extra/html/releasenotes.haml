      %h2 Version 1.0.1 by AlterStep
      %time Mon, 28 Apr 2014
      %p
        Include the release version of dnscrypt-proxy 1.4, with a new
        OpenNIC resolver.
      %p
        Wait after dnscrypt-proxy has been turned on before sending a
        query. This actually makes state changes faster.
      %p
        Debug log, turned off by default and deleted after every
        reboot. In order to enable it, create an empty file named
        %code debug.enabled
        in
        %code /Library/Application Support/DNSCrypt/control
        and the debug log file itself is
        %code /var/log/dnscrypt-osxclient-debug.log
      %p
        Thanks a lot for your feedback on the first version!
