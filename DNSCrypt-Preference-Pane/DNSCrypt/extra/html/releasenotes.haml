    %article
      %h2 Version 0.16 released!
      %time Wed, 19 Sep 2012
      %ul
        %li dnscrypt-proxy has been updated to 1.1.0-RC2.
        %li Support for plugins has been added.
        %li
          The system DNS cache is now flushed after a network configuration
          change.

    %article
      %h2 Version 0.15 released!
      %time Wed, 07 Sep 2012
      %ul
        %li dnscrypt-proxy has been updated to 1.1.0-RC1
        %li
          Queries for nowtv.com and fritz.com are now bypassing dnscrypt.
        %li
          The user interface doesn't update the DNS settings any more when
          using an interactive shell.

    %article
      %h2 Version 0.14 released!
      %time Wed, 08 Aug 2012
      %ul
        %li The preference pane can now run on OSX 10.6.

    %article
      %h2 Version 0.13 released!
      %time Wed, 08 Aug 2012
      %ul
        %li The DNS cache is now flushed after a configuration change.
        %li
          The release notes are now bundled with the preference pane.
          This reduces the startup time and ensures that these notes are
          consistent with the currently running version.

    %article
      %h2 Version 0.12 released!
      %time Mon, 06 Aug 2012
      %ul
        %li
          The "fallback to insecure" mode now properly copes with captive
          portals and firewalls.
        %li
          The TCP/443 checkbox is gone. When the dnscrypt box is
          checked, it tries everything in parallel and keeps whatever
          works best.
        %li
          IPv6 is fully supported (and automatic. If that works using
          IPv6, IPv6 is used)
        %li
          Familyshield is supported, with and without dnscrypt.
        %li
          OpenDNS/DNSCrypt/Familyshield/Fallback settings can be set
          from the menu bar.
        %li
          Internal domain names like routerlogin.net are directly sent
          to the router or to whatever DNS resolvers the DHCP server provides.
        %li
          Packages are signed for Mountain Lion.
        %li
          The interface passively watches for network changes according to the
          current network configuration and the current Wifi access
          point. It doesn't constantly poll for changes any more.
        %li
          The proxy has been updated to version 1.0.1.
