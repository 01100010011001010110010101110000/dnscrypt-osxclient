    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.19</h2>
      <time>Wed, 10 Oct 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>dnscrypt-proxy has been updated to version 1.2.0.</li>
        <li>
          AAAA queries are filtered out on networks with no IPv6
          connectivity in order to significantly reduce latency.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.18</h2>
      <time>Wed,  3 Oct 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>
          freebox.fr has been added to the default list of domains
          for which DNSCrypt should be bypassed.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a static resolvers set has been specified, this will now be
          used for exceptions instead of DHCP-provided servers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Minor cosmetic fixes and documentation improvements have been
          made.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.17</h2>
      <time>Fri, 28 Sep 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>dnscrypt-proxy has been updated to 1.1.0-final.</li>
        <li>The uninstaller is now bundled with the preference pane.</li>
        <li>
          Static default DNS resolvers can now be used instead of
          having them provided by a DHCP server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Logging: outgoing queries can now be logged and displayed in
          real time.
        </li>
        <li>
          IP-based blocking: DNS responses containing IP addresses
          present in a user-defined set of addresses can be blocked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pattern-based name blocking: block domain names matching
          suffixes, prefixes and substrings.
        </li>
        <li>
          A list of exceptions that should bypass DNSCrypt and be
          resolved by a local server can be now specified.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.16 released!</h2>
      <time>Wed, 19 Sep 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>dnscrypt-proxy has been updated to 1.1.0-RC2.</li>
        <li>Support for plugins has been added.</li>
        <li>
          The system DNS cache is now flushed after a network configuration
          change.
        </li>
        <li>
          The startup scripts can now handle plugins, static DNS
          configurations and user-defined exceptions lists. These new
          settings are not accessible through the user interface yet, but can
          be configured using control files.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.15 released!</h2>
      <time>Fri, 07 Sep 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>dnscrypt-proxy has been updated to 1.1.0-RC1</li>
        <li>
          Queries for nowtv.com and fritz.com are now bypassing dnscrypt.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user interface doesn't update the DNS settings any more when
          using an interactive shell.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.14 released!</h2>
      <time>Wed, 08 Aug 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>The preference pane can now run on OSX 10.6.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.13 released!</h2>
      <time>Wed, 08 Aug 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>The DNS cache is now flushed after a configuration change.</li>
        <li>
          The release notes are now bundled with the preference pane.
          This reduces the startup time and ensures that these notes are
          consistent with the currently running version.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.12 released!</h2>
      <time>Mon, 06 Aug 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The "fallback to insecure" mode now properly copes with captive
          portals and firewalls.
        </li>
        <li>
          The TCP/443 checkbox is gone. When the dnscrypt box is
          checked, it tries everything in parallel and keeps whatever
          works best.
        </li>
        <li>
          IPv6 is fully supported (and automatic. If that works using
          IPv6, IPv6 is used)
        </li>
        <li>
          Familyshield is supported, with and without dnscrypt.
        </li>
        <li>
          OpenDNS/DNSCrypt/Familyshield/Fallback settings can be set
          from the menu bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Internal domain names like routerlogin.net are directly sent
          to the router or to whatever DNS resolvers the DHCP server provides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Packages are signed for Mountain Lion.
        </li>
        <li>
          The interface passively watches for network changes according to the
          current network configuration and the current Wifi access
          point. It doesn't constantly poll for changes any more.
        </li>
        <li>
          The proxy has been updated to version 1.0.1.
        </li>
