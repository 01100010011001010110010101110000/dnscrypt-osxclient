    <h1>Release Notes</h1>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.12 released!</h2>
      <time>Thu, 06 Aug 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The "fallback to insecure" mode now properly copes with captive
          portals and firewalls.
        </li>
        <li>
          The TCP/443 checkbox is gone. When the dnscrypt box is
          checked, it tries everything in parallel and keeps whatever
          works best.
        </li>
        <li>
          IPv6 is fully supported (and automatic. If that works using
          IPv6, IPv6 is used)
        </li>
        <li>
          Familyshield is supported, with and without dnscrypt.
        </li>
        <li>
          OpenDNS/DNSCrypt/Familyshield/Fallback settings can be set
          from the menu bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Internal domain names like routerlogin.net are directly sent
          to the router or to whatever DNS resolvers the DHCP server provides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Packages are signed for Mountain Lion.
        </li>
        <li>
          The interface passively watches for network changes according to the
          current network configuration and the current Wifi access
          point. It doesn't constantly poll for changes any more.
        </li>
        <li>
          The proxy has been updated to version 1.0.1.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>
          Some content in the preferences pane wasn't always
          properly loaded on Snow Leopard. This has been fixed.
        </li>
      </ul>
