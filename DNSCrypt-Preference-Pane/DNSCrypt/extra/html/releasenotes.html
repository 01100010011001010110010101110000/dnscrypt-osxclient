    <h1>Release Notes for the user interface</h1>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.17</h2>
      <time>Fri, 28 Sep 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>dnscrypt-proxy has been updated to 1.1.0-final.</li>
        <li>The uninstaller is now bundled with the preference pane.</li>
        <li>
          Static default DNS resolvers can now be used instead of
          having them provided by a DHCP server.
        </li>
        <li>Advanced parental controls.</li>
        <li>
          Logging: outgoing queries can now be logged and displayed in
          real time.
        </li>
        <li>
          OpenDNS networks settings lock-in: use your own network
          settings no matter what actual network you are connected to.
          Now, you can stay protected from botnets, malware, phishing, and
          block unwanted content, even when using public Wi-Fi hotspots.
        </li>
        <li>
          IP-based blocking: DNS responses containing IP addresses
          present in a user-defined set of addresses can be blocked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pattern-based name blocking: block domain names matching
          suffixes, prefixes and substrings.
        </li>
        <li>
          A list of exceptions that should bypass DNSCrypt and be
          resolved by a local server can be now specified.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.16 released!</h2>
      <time>Wed, 19 Sep 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>dnscrypt-proxy has been updated to 1.1.0-RC2.</li>
        <li>Support for plugins has been added.</li>
        <li>
          The system DNS cache is now flushed after a network configuration
          change.
        </li>
        <li>
          The startup scripts can now handle plugins, static DNS
          configurations and user-defined exceptions lists. These new
          settings are not accessible through the user interface yet, but can
          be configured using control files.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.15 released!</h2>
      <time>Fri, 07 Sep 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>dnscrypt-proxy has been updated to 1.1.0-RC1</li>
        <li>
          Queries for nowtv.com and fritz.com are now bypassing dnscrypt.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user interface doesn't update the DNS settings any more when
          using an interactive shell.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.14 released!</h2>
      <time>Wed, 08 Aug 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>The preference pane can now run on OSX 10.6.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.13 released!</h2>
      <time>Wed, 08 Aug 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>The DNS cache is now flushed after a configuration change.</li>
        <li>
          The release notes are now bundled with the preference pane.
          This reduces the startup time and ensures that these notes are
          consistent with the currently running version.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Version 0.12 released!</h2>
      <time>Mon, 06 Aug 2012</time>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The "fallback to insecure" mode now properly copes with captive
          portals and firewalls.
        </li>
        <li>
          The TCP/443 checkbox is gone. When the dnscrypt box is
          checked, it tries everything in parallel and keeps whatever
          works best.
        </li>
        <li>
          IPv6 is fully supported (and automatic. If that works using
          IPv6, IPv6 is used)
        </li>
        <li>
          Familyshield is supported, with and without dnscrypt.
        </li>
        <li>
          OpenDNS/DNSCrypt/Familyshield/Fallback settings can be set
          from the menu bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Internal domain names like routerlogin.net are directly sent
          to the router or to whatever DNS resolvers the DHCP server provides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Packages are signed for Mountain Lion.
        </li>
        <li>
          The interface passively watches for network changes according to the
          current network configuration and the current Wifi access
          point. It doesn't constantly poll for changes any more.
        </li>
        <li>
          The proxy has been updated to version 1.0.1.
        </li>
      </ul>
