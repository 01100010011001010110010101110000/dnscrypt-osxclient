      <h2>Static DNS servers</h2>
      <p>
        If you are not using DHCP and want a statically configured set
        of default DNS resolvers, enter their IP addresses in this box.
      </p>
      <p>
        Separate them with spaces.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Advanced parental controls</h2>
      <p>
        When using DNSCrypt, this will block the following list of OpenDNS
        categories: lingerie/bikini, adult themes, nudity,
        pornography, proxy/anonymizer, sexuality and tasteless.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have an OpenDNS account and network settings defined
        for your current location, the network settings will override the
        advanced parental controls. Having an OpenDNS account allows
        finer granularity access controls, building reports and more.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Log DNS queries</h2>
      <p>
        As a tool designed to protect your privacy, the DNSCrypt proxy does
        not log anything about your DNS queries. Nothing about them will be
        saved to disk ever, and log messages are intentionally kept as generic
        as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you still may want to look at the DNS queries sent by
        your system. This can be useful in order to spot suspicious
        activity and to refine your domain blacklists and whitelists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Checking the "Log DNS queries" box dumps all DNS queries sent
        by your computer to a file named /var/log/dnscrypt-query.log
      </p>
      <p>
        The "View log" button opens it with the log viewer application
        so that you can watch it in real time.
      </p>

      <h2>Lock-in the current network settings</h2>
      <p>
        If you have an OpenDNS account, and OpenDNS network settings
        defined for your current location, you can make these
        persistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Checking this box will make the user interface remember what
        your current network is.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are roaming, the settings for this network will still be
        used, no matter what actual network you are connected to.
      </p>
      <p>
        That way, you can stay protected from botnets, malware,
        phishing and block unwanted content, even when using public
        Wi-Fi hotspots.
      </p>
      <p>
        This feature is currently not compatible with the OpenDNS IP
        updater. If your ISP assigns dynamic IP addresses, use either
        the OpenDNS IP updater or the DNSCrypt lock-in feature, but not both.
      </p>

      <h2>IP addresses blocking</h2>
      <p>
        A response to a query containing at least one IP address
        listed here will be blocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        This make it easy to block spam sources, hosting services and content
        providers using a lot of different domain names for a single service.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can also be useful in order to block DNS rebinding
        attacks, even for non-private network spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        IP addresses can be IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and must be
        separated with spaces.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Names blocking</h2>
      <p>
        This is a list of domain names to be blocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't affect your OpenDNS network settings. This is a
        local blacklist, applied in addition to your OpenDNS settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        "example.com" will only match this specific name, not
        "www.example.com".
      </p>
      <p>
        But wildcards are also supported. "*.example.com" will match
        any name ending with ".example.com" whereas "ads.*" will match
        any name beginning with "ads."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wildcards can also perform substring matching. "*xxx*" will
        match any name containing the string "xxx".
      </p>
      <p>
        Patterns to be blocked should be separated with spaces, and
        the blocking takes effect immediately after you hit the Return
        key. Flushing your DNS cache is not required.
      </p>
      <p>
        This feature is only enabled when using DNSCrypt.
      </p>

      <h2>Exceptions - bypassing OpenDNS for some specific names</h2>
      <p>
        Some domain names should not be resolved by a third-party DNS
        resolver, that may not know about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This includes local domain names provided by home routers
        (like "routerlogin.net"), local domain names provided by
        operating systems and applications (like ".local" or ".lan"),
        local domain names served by appliances like st-top boxes, and
        internal domains used in corporate networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domains listed here will bypass DNSCrypt in order to be sent
        to the default resolvers.
