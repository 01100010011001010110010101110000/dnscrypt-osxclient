    %h1 About DNSCrypt
    %p
      This software encrypts and authenticates DNS packets between your computer
      and OpenDNS. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and snooping of DNS
      traffic by ISPs or others.

      Tips:
      %ul
        %li If you have a firewall, open TCP and UDP ports 53 and 443.
        %li
          The "Fallback to insecure" feature automatically disables
          DNSCrypt when DNS queries are not able to reach OpenDNS. This usually
          happens on public WiFi networks that require going through a captive
          portal before you can access external networks.
          This function is only provided for conveniency.
          When enabled, the protocol can be easily downgraded by
          third-parties. In other words, when enabled, this software doesn't
          provide any security at all against active attackers, but it can
          still be useful against passive attackers and in order to bypass
          DNS censorship. Don't enable it unless you are frequently
          roaming and you don't want to manually disable/enable DNSCrypt.

          The FamilyShield service blocks pornographic content,
          including OpenDNS "Pornography", "Tasteless" and "Sexuality"
          categories, in addition to proxies and anonymizers (which can render
          filtering useless). It also blocks phishing and some malware.
